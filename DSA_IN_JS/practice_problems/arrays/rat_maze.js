/**
 * We have discussed Backtracking and Knightâ€™s tour problem in Set 1.
 * Let us discuss Rat in a Maze as another example problem that can be solved using Backtracking.

A Maze is given as N*N binary matrix of blocks where source block is the upper left most block i.e.,
maze[0][0] and destination block is lower rightmost block i.e., maze[N-1][N-1].
A rat starts from source and has to reach the destination.
The rat can move only in two directions: forward and down.

In the maze matrix,
    0 means the block is a dead end and 1 means the block can be used in the path from source to destination.
     Note that this is a simple version of the typical Maze problem.
     For example, a more complex version can be that the rat can move in 4 directions and a more complex version can be with a limited number of moves.
